    "description" : "The interactions executed inside one zone are checked by and enforced in the scope of a PEP assigned for that zone. The approach is similar for the zones that consist of geographically dispersed locations: each PEP (or sub-PEP) is responsible for its geographical unit or layer. Being the single point of contact of a zone, the PEP is primarily responsible for checking incoming and outgoing requests. In the second instance, depending on security settings and application requirements, PEP might serve as an inter-zone communication gateway, as well.",
